Now run 
 ```bash
docker run -p 49160:8082 -d creative-difficulty/eucoapi_1
 ```
 to run the container.
 You can replace ```8082``` with the physical port you want EucoAPI running at.
 to view the console output of EucoAPI, first get its CONTAINER ID (```docker ps```).
 Then run ```docker logs <CONTAINER ID>```. 
 
 Happy Docking!
